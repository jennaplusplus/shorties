How would it feel to lose the company to a man who has less hair on his bleep than I have on my bleep?"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Michael: It can't be worse than hearing that just was."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Ted: I guess I couldn't see through the glasses, and I slid into the ladder..."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Lucille: Give G.O.B. the boat.

You kissed?"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"George Michael: Even a little more than that.

They were really rough... pictures."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Michael: No, I remember their birth announcement like it was yesterday."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"George Michael: I mean, I know it's wrong, you know, but, uh, my feelings are real even... even if it was a mistake."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Michael: Well, obviously, acting on those feelings is not an option. She's a blood relative."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"George Michael: I know. I've seen the blood."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Michael: Now, how long has this been going on?"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"George Michael: I don't know. 53 weeks? I can't be around her with these feelings anymore, and that's why I'm-I'm not going to this party."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Narrator: And so Michael made another compromise of his values for the sake of the business."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Michael: Whatever happened to that Ann we were both so crazy about?

I'm adopted?"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Stan Sitwell: I'm sorry. I thought you knew. Have I upset you?"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Lindsay: Are you kidding me? This is the happiest I've been since the day I got my new nose! I'm not a Bluth!"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Stan Sitwell: You were almost a Sitwell, but 37 years ago, the Bluths adopted you out from under us. So we said good-bye to you—our darling little three-year-old..."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Lindsay: Uh, wait, “three-year-old”? Uh, you said it was 37 years ago."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Stan Sitwell: Oh, yeah, right. Hey, we should do something for your 40th next week."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Narrator: This part of the news Lindsay didn't take that well."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Lindsay: Let me bleep. Get your bleep hands..."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Stan Sitwell: Be gentle! She's almost 40!"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Narrator: Maeby, meanwhile, returned to Tantamount Studios, where word was, she was to be replaced when it was discovered she wasn't the age she claimed to be."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Maeby: Please don't fire me."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Mort Meyers: Fire you? Are you kidding? I've already gotten ten requests for the TV rights to your story. You got to get your family to sign the release papers. This is the biggest thing to happen since Uniprod hired that wee-brain to run Drama Development."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Narrator: Michael had compromised his morals, and was having trouble sleeping. Of course, some of that was Lindsay."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Michael: Are you drunk?"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Lindsay: A little. We need to talk."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Michael: Yeah, I'll say. Are you aware that your daughter and my son have been getting physical? I mean, can you imagine anything that inappropriate?"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Lindsay: (Climbs on top of Michael.)"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Michael: Whoa. I guess you can. What're you doing?"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Lindsay: I'm not your sister."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Michael: What?"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Lindsay: I'm adopted."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Michael: Wait, Lindsay..."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Lindsay: And I'm three years older."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Michael: Hey, there must be some mistake."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Lindsay: No. Mom confirmed it. And I know you've always found me attractive. You've been telling me that for the last 40 years."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Michael: Wait, Lindsay. This is crazy."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Lindsay: If I don't get divorced and remarry in the next month, I'm going to sell those shares, and I'm gonna cash out. So, what do you say?"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Narrator: But even Michael couldn't sell out that much."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Michael: I'm just not that into older women."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Lindsay: You bastard!"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Narrator: Michael had just found out his sister was adopted. And the next morning, he awoke to a worse surprise."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Michael: Oh, come on."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Tobias: Well, I can't sleep in the same room as her. She wants out of this marriage, fine. I-I'm afraid I'm going have to sell the Bluth shares and move on."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Michael: You can't do that."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Tobias: They're my shares."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Michael: No, I mean, you can't spoon me like that."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Tobias: Oh."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Michael: We need a new venue for the shareholders' party, and it cannot be a boat. Now, if you can find something, maybe I can fudge the books, get you a Bluth Company salary, huh? Maybe call you an events coordinator."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Tobias: Can we just lay here for a second while I think about it?"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Narrator: Michael was making compromises all over the place."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Michael: Sure."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"twenty minutes later..."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Tobias: I'll do it."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Michael: Sounds great."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Narrator: Soon, George Michael went to Ann's to try to win her back. But her Uncle Paul told him that Ann had moved in with her boyfriend. He also mentioned that we all only had three more weeks on earth, and that fossils were just something the Jews buried in 1924. And so, feeling that he couldn't go home, George Michael decided to seek out his own creepy uncle, and Michael confronted his mother about the adoption."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Lucille: Look, she was better off with us. He wanted to call her Nellie."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Michael: Of course. Lindsay is the Nellie from the photo. Why didn't you just tell people that she was adopted?"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Lucille: Adopting a child we didn't want just to stick it to a competitor. Well, that'd make us look great."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Michael: You're right, Mom. People would have twisted that story to make you look bad."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Lucille: I don't see what the big deal is. We loved her just as much as any of you normal kids. More than G.O.B."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Michael: The big deal, Mom, is that the family is falling apart. They're trying to sell their stock, and I can't promise you that I can keep everyone together until the party."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Lucille: We'll pay them off. We'll call it an accrued cash dividend, but they won't get their money until sign a document at the party promising not to sell for ten years."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Michael: So, it's embezzlement, bribery and conspiracy?"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Lucille: And a whole lot of love."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Michael: Oh, yeah, and perjury."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Tobias: Oh, Michael."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Michael: Hey. Oh."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Tobias: I booked the perfect location and some wonderful performers for the party. We're having it at the Queen Mary."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Buster: (Gasps.)

It's on the Long Beach Harbor."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Buster: That's the ship."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Michael: Buster, don't worry about it. They've actually welded it to the dock."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Tobias: Although, perhaps I should call the “Hot Cops” and tell them to come up with something more nautically themed.

Me, too."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Narrator: And George Michael was about to come across a hot seaman of his own."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"George Michael: Uncle G.O.B.?"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"G.O.B.: What are you doing here?
