We haven't even been paid yet."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Michael: That's exactly why I hired her, to help out with the finances. She's absolutely amazing at that stuff, right?

Really? And all the guys like her, huh? That is, that is, that is great. Uh, you mean “away,” though, right? Because otherwise it sounds a little different, but, uh, that's, uh, that's outstanding. You forgot to say “away” again. But listen, let me call you back in a bit, okay? Bye. (To Lindsay.) Nellie has blown them all away."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Lindsay: Yeah, well, I think it's crazy. You've given her access to everything— the banking and for what? I mean, you're basing this whole thing on the fact that she shares a name with someone you played with as a baby."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Michael: Lindsay, I can tell that it's real. It's like that feeling that you read about twins having."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Lindsay: We're twins. You didn't give me access to the banking."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Michael: No, you'd just, you'd go out and you'd just whore it up, Lindsay, you know? Now she's different.

I want to make sure that she trusts me, you know. Especially since Dad is probably setting her up.

Yo, man, you owe me money. I ain't no dummy. It better be soon or you're going to feel my hand up your bleep."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Michael: So Nellie wants to meet me tonight for drinks.
