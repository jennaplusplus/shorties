Just pure crap."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Michael: But we're back on track, and we are scandal free."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Lucille: Hey! You start the meeting without me?"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Michael: Mother, uh, this is Cal Cullen. You remember my mother, Lucille. We're right in the middle of talking about this exciting giveaway spa package to entice buyers."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Lucille: You know, he's never taken me anywhere.

Yeah, I could've used your help with Mom."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"G.O.B.: I believe I told you I was gonna be out for the holidays. It's spring break. Not that I can enjoy it.

You're going to be so easy to blackmail. Hint."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Lindsay: This pig Phillip Litt is out there asking girls to take their tops off. It's an outrage."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"G.O.B.: Well, of course you feel that way. You're jealous. You're a surfboard. But, I do agree, he is a pig... Hey, what the hell was that for?"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Michael: Can we stop worrying about Girls with Low Self-Esteem, and start focusing on sobering up the woman who gave us ours? No, seriously what do you think about rehab?"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Tobias: Well, she won't go willingly, I can tell you that."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"G.O.B.: May I make a suggestion?

Let's just wait until she's crawling around on her own.”"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Lucille: I'm so embarrassed about that.

How did you find me?"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Kitty: I thought you were dead, until I saw Scandalmakers.

I just... I gotta get my hands on that evidence. The problem is, I just checked her in to rehab.

This objectification of women has to stop."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Michael: It's just Mom and whores."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Lindsay: No, how would you like it?

Get their clothes off."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Tobias: That is a great... (Grunts.) That is a great social statement. I shall get the video camera. This is ripe for parody. This is ripe."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Buster: He just wants to see boys' Linuses."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Buster: Oh, go..."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Michael: Here we go."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Narrator: And so Michael went back to see his mom."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Michael: I-I know that you're upset with me because I brought you here under false pretenses, but I really was worried about you."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Lucille: Oh, please.

You do not think like a magician. Such a “How dey do dat.”"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Michael: Uh-huh."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"G.O.B.: It's a classic bait and switch. This is a decoy cooler.

Ow! Ow! Ow!"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"G.O.B.: Well, I'm no longer needed here."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Michael: No, no, no. I think the cooler's actually going to help us.
