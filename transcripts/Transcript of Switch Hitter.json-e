Right before we play his company in softball?"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Michael: No, no. Our business is in trouble, and I think he sees an opportunity, so, I figured the guy's a family man. Why not invite him over, and let him see us in our element?"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Maeby: Well, I hope you don't mean the whole family, 'cause George Michael's off with Ann."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Michael: Ann? Hmm. That'll play well with Sitwell. Where's your son? He's out with Ann. Who's Ann? Don't ask me, I'm just the boy's father."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"G.O.B.: Hey, screw Sitwell.

Okay. So, you have to read this and then explain it, and this is important: you have to say it in my own words, okay? Smart, but not too smart. Let's have a four syllable max."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Michael: Do you want to say something, or should I, Tobias?"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Tobias: No. I believe in letting children learn from their mistakes, Michael.

I pass. You look surprised."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Stan Sitwell: I'm sorry. I must have put it on too high. But you were right. It was a bad offer, and you were smart enough not to take it.

Wow, you're President again?"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Michael: Yes. This is the way it should be. What do you think of when you hear the word Sudden Valley?"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"George Michael: Salad dressing, I think. But for some reason, I don't want to eat it."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Michael: Right. But Paradise Gardens..."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"George Michael: Yeah. Okay, I can... I can see marinating a chicken in that. I'm actually here about the softball game. We need some girls on the team this year, right?"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Michael: Yes, we do.

You know, she could play my position."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Michael: You should be playing the field. There. In right. You know? Plus, I got Aunt Lindsay playing this year.

I'm back!"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Michael: You just left."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"G.O.B.: Yeah, I don't think things are gonna work out with Sitwell.

He and Lucille were an item, before she left him for Oscar."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Narrator: At the studio, Tobias began to create buzz around the water cooler."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Tobias: That Fünke is some kind of something. Boy, this Fünke is all anybody's ever talking about. I'm so sick and tired of hearing about how brilliant that Fünke is. Overrated. We'll just move on. Whoa, oh, I'm sorry! I'm sorry. Okay, we're okay. Okay."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Narrator: Meanwhile, Maeby looked for an empty office to call George Michael."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Maeby: Where are you? I bought you a day. I can't put this book report off forever."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Jeff: Sorry, is this your office?"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Maeby: No, I'm just sitting behind someone else's desk, pretending these are my kids.

Lunch with Jim... Carrey. He's the Grinch guy. You're too young."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"G.O.B.: So get this.

I'll meet you there. I've got a neck hair fitting at 11:00."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Narrator: G.O.B. was both angry... and overwhelmed by the approval from this new father figure.

You can't do this. You're gonna lose the game and you're going to lose the company and you can't do this."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Michael: Come on, what are you saying? If I win the game, you're comfortable with me running the company?"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"George, Sr.: Yeah, that's what I'm saying."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Michael: I'll win the game.
