Now, I just need to find a trick that puts you out of oxygen for 20 minutes."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Michael: Sorry, did I hear the word “trick”? And it smells a lot like lighter fluid in here. You know, I did say no tricks, G.O.B., and I mean it."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"G.O.B.: What if I find a trick that has her float to the alter or something?"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Michael: No, no.

Can I come in?"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Rita: I can't let you in."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Michael: You didn't show up last night. The least you can do is talk to me face-to-face."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Rita: I can't. Trevor locked the door. He doesn't want me to be with you."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Michael: What? He locked the door? You can't unlock this door?"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Rita: I can't even see half the locks."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Michael: Rita?

I think it's 'cause of her accent and the plastic surgery she's been able to afford. We wouldn't have this trouble if they'd met last year. I got to put a stop to this. We're gonna search every bloody hotel in town."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Lucille: Oh, Legoland.
